# Object-Detection
Object detection using tensorflow using emojis.

## Important Points:
1. Used python version 2.4
2. Made functional model with multiple outputs
3. Made a custom metric IoU [Intersection of Union] to update and reset the states of the model.
4. Made a custom callback to display test images and prediction during training.
5. Used Early Stopping callback and learning rate scheduler.

Sample picture during training:
